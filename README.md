# Alias
Artifacts 1 and 2 for my Alias Capstone project

Alias is a narrative-driven sci-fi prototype built in Unreal Engine 5, where the player awakens from cryostasis with fragmented memories.
This demo showcases:

A custom skybox environment (star + nebula backdrop).

Callisa’s character model as a first-person controllable pawn.

AI enemy prototype (basic perception + combat loop).

Core narrative tone and atmosphere for the full project.

Alias is being developed as part of my GAM 495 Capstone to demonstrate my specialization in gameplay programming, environment design, and AI systems.


**Features in Demo**

Custom Skybox: Procedurally designed cosmic backdrop for atmosphere.

Player Controller: First-person setup using Callisa’s character mesh, with movement, jumping, and interaction.

AI System: Enemy patrols, perception (sight/hearing), and simple attack logic.

Pickups (optional): Weapons, health, or energy cores for testing.

Cinematic Mood: Tone-setting environment with lighting/VFX.


**Technologies Used**

Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprint + C++)

Blender (mesh prep)

Photoshop (textures)

Behavior Trees & AI Perception in UE5

Git/GitHub for version control
